These tests mirror the unittests from the translatable module, 
with two exceptions:

- Locale Get Param Redirects To Translation
  -----------------------------------------
  replaced URLSegment in:
  response = $this->get(Controller::join_links($origPage->URLSegment, '?locale=de_DE'));
  by Link():
  response = $this->get(Controller::join_links($origPage->Link(), '?locale=de_DE'));

  get() expects a valid link, and URLSegment misses the prefix so it doesn't qualify here.
  I think this replacement is valid: because an url isn't a URLSegment per se.


- test Alternate Get By Link
  --------------------------
  Trying to get property of non-object
  Added true as a param to the homepage link, because SiteTree::get_by_link()
  cannot resolve the homepage URLSegment from a prefixed link:

  SiteTree::get_by_link($page->Link(true))

  There is no way to influence this behaviour.  

  The only issue I see in core, is the use SiteTree::Page() and SiteTree::ChildrenOf().

  SiteTree::get_by_link() will work as if the locale prefix is not there, 
  just like it would in any other situation, with the exception of homepagelinks 
  with a locale prefix.  Do not use '/en_US/' in any form. You can use '/' 
  which will return the homepage for the current locale. Something 
  like '/en_US/home' or Link(true) is also valid.
