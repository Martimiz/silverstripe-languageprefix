These tests mirror the unittests from the translatable module, 
with two exceptions:

- Locale Get Param Redirects To Translation
  -----------------------------------------
  replaced URLSegment in:
  response = $this->get(Controller::join_links($origPage->URLSegment, '?locale=de_DE'));
  by Link():
  response = $this->get(Controller::join_links($origPage->Link(), '?locale=de_DE'));

  get() expects a valid link, and URLSegment misses the prefix so it doesn't qualify here.
  I think this replacement is valid: because an url isn't a URLSegment per se.


- test Alternate Get By Link
  --------------------------
  Trying to get property of non-object
  Replaced instances of:
  SiteTree::get_by_link($page->Link())
  by:
  SiteTree::get_by_link($page->RelativeLink())

  I'm not sure this is valid. Although get_by_link is seldom used like this
  in core, I still think this might be an issue... 

  The only problem I see is in using SiteTree::Page() and SiteTree::ChildrenOf()
  if these functions are used with a full link as parameter...
